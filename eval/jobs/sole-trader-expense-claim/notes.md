# sole-trader-expense-claim: how the expected trial balance was worked out

Worked by hand from the documents themselves, cross-checked against each fixture's `expected.json`. The app, the
API, the ledger, the posting code and the extractor were not run to produce or check any figure.
`ledgersync/accounts.py`, `ledgersync/posting.py`, `ledgersync/checks.py` and `ledgersync/matching.py` were read
only for the chart and the posting conventions.

## Client and year

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Name | Sam Rivers | Neither document names the business. This is a test name for a sole trader trading under their own name. It shares no word with any counterparty, so the client's own name can't make the ledger pair two rows by name. |
| Business type | `sole_trader` | The case is a sole trader. The owner's personal spending goes through 3260 Drawings, not 2250 Director's Loan Account. |
| VAT registered | no | Neither document shows a VAT number, a VAT amount or a payment to HMRC. No document here shows VAT, so this changes no figure either way. |
| Contact email | sam.rivers@example.com | Reserved test domain. |
| First year end | 2027-03-31 | The client's first year runs 1 Apr 2026 to 31 Mar 2027. The expense claim is dated 12/09/2026 and the bank lines run 01/10 to 28/10/2026. |

## Documents

| File | Copied from | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `documents/expense-note.txt` | `eval/fixtures/text-expense-note-mixed/input.txt` | Expense claim, 12/09/2026: Breakfast £18.00, Taxi to client £32.00, Total £50.00 |
| `documents/bank-october.csv` | `eval/fixtures/csv-unseen-mixed/input.csv` | Bank CSV: 20 lines with running balances, 01/10 to 28/10/2026 |

## Conventions used (from accounts.py, posting.py, checks.py and matching.py)

- An expense claim's lines are owed to the claimant until paid. Their other side is 2110 Expenses Owed to Staff.
- A bank line posts to its account against 1200 Bank, with no VAT.
- Not VAT registered: no VAT is booked on anything.
- A bank line pays a claim only if it is the same way, dated on or after the claim within 31 days, and for its open
  amount (or names the claimant). No line here is for £50.00.

## Rows and their double entry

### The expense claim (other side 2110)

| # | Date | Description | Way | Gross | Account | Debit | Credit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | 12/09/2026 | Breakfast | out | 18.00 | 7406 Subsistence | 7406 18.00 | 2110 18.00 |
| C2 | 12/09/2026 | Taxi to client | out | 32.00 | 7400 Travel | 7400 32.00 | 2110 32.00 |

The lines total 18.00 + 32.00 = 50.00, which agrees with the printed "Total £50.00".

### The bank lines (other side 1200)

Every row has one debit and one credit of the same amount, so every row balances.

**Money out, added line by line (B1 and B3 to B20):** 32.40, then 118.70, 124.30, 244.30, 274.30, 298.80, 847.80,
941.80, 1141.80, 1163.55, 1201.75, 1212.74, 1230.74, 1440.74, 1453.23, 1500.03, 1561.08, 1626.08 and 1654.07.

**Statement check.** The first line's printed balance is 8,967.60 after 32.40 out, so the opening balance is
9,000.00. Each printed balance follows from the one before:

| Line | Movement | Balance |
|---|---|---|
| B2 | +3,150.00 | 12,117.60 |
| B3 | −86.30 | 12,031.30 |
| B4 | −5.60 | 12,025.70 |
| B5 | −120.00 | 11,905.70 |
| B6 | −30.00 | 11,875.70 |
| B7 | −24.50 | 11,851.20 |
| B8 | −549.00 | 11,302.20 |
| B9 | −94.00 | 11,208.20 |
| B10 | −200.00 | 11,008.20 |
| B11 | −21.75 | 10,986.45 |
| B12 | −38.20 | 10,948.25 |
| B13 | −10.99 | 10,937.26 |
| B14 | −18.00 | 10,919.26 |
| B15 | −210.00 | 10,709.26 |
| B16 | −12.49 | 10,696.77 |
| B17 | −46.80 | 10,649.97 |
| B18 | −61.05 | 10,588.92 |
| B19 | −65.00 | 10,523.92 |
| B20 | −27.99 | 10,495.93 |

The statement reconciles. Its movement is 10,495.93 − 9,000.00 = +1,495.93, which agrees with 3,150.00 − 1,654.07.

## Per-account sums

| Account | Debits | Credits | Net (Dr − Cr) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0030 Office Equipment | 549.00 (B8) | | **549.00** |

| 7504 Office Stationery | 32.40 (B1) + 27.99 (B20) = 60.39 | | **60.39** |

| 8205 Refreshments | 21.75 (B11) + 46.80 (B17) = 68.55 | | **68.55** |

Nothing is left in 9998 Suspense, so it has no line.

Check, adding the debit nets in table order: 549.00, then 669.00, 2164.93, 2464.43, 2525.48, 2575.48, 2669.48,
2707.68, 2731.28, 2743.77, 2773.77, 2834.16, 2920.46, 3131.45 and 3200.00. The credit nets are
50.00 + 3150.00 = 3200.00. The expected trial balance sums to zero.

## Judgement calls

1. **The claim is owed on 2110 Expenses Owed to Staff.** That is the app's convention for an expense claim, and the
   case tests "claim lines owed to staff". The note doesn't say who claimed. If it was the owner's own spending, an
   accountant might credit 3010 Capital Introduced instead. The documents don't say, so that is not expected.
2. **No bank line repays the claim.** There is no £50.00 line, nor one for £18.00 or £32.00, so 2110 stays at
   −50.00. A bank line linked to the claim is wrong.
3. **Claim lines: Breakfast to 7406 Subsistence, Taxi to client to 7400 Travel.** This agrees with the fixture's
   `expected.json`.
4. **Drawings, which this case is meant to test.** All three are departures from the fixture's `expected.json`,
   which puts B7, B15, B19 and B10 in 9998. Those labels were made for reading one document with no client known,
   where Suspense means "for a person to review". Here the business is known to be a sole trader. The model reads each
   row knowing the business is a sole trader, and is told to use Suspense only when nothing fits. The three Drawings rows:
   - **B15 SELFRIDGES £210.00 → 3260 Drawings.** A department store with no business purpose shown: for a sole
     trader, personal spending.
   - **B7 ETSY £24.50 → 3260 Drawings.** A marketplace with no business purpose shown. It is treated the same way as
     Selfridges, because the fixture conventions class a marketplace and a department store together. This is the
     least certain call: 7504 Office Stationery is the main alternative if it were supplies.
   - **B19 CAMDEN COUNCIL PENALTY CHARGE £65.00 → 3260 Drawings.** A fine is not a business expense. A sole
     trader's own fine is a personal cost, so it goes to Drawings. The alternative, 7400 Travel added back for
     tax, is rejected.
5. **B10 LINKEDIN ADS £200.00 → 8201 Subscriptions and Software.** This departs from the fixture's
   `expected.json`, which has 9998. LinkedIn Ads is a known, allowable business cost (advertising), so a careful
   accountant wouldn't leave it in Suspense at the year end. A row left in 9998 is flagged for a person to check.
   - The chart has no advertising account. The nearest fit is 8201, whose definition covers "online services";
     LinkedIn Ads is a self-serve online advertising service.
   - The alternative is 7603 Professional Fees ("other professional services"), which fits less well: no
     professional is engaged.
   - A reading that picks 7603 will differ on 8201 (−200.00) and 7603 (+200.00): a judgement call, not
     necessarily a mistake.
6. **Accounts that follow the chart's own definitions and the fixture's labels:**
   - B4 GREGGS → 7406 Subsistence: a bakery or takeaway.
   - B11 MORRISONS → 8205 Refreshments: a supermarket with no item detail is workplace groceries.
   - B3 TRAVIS PERKINS → 7800 Repairs and Renewals: a builders' merchant, so tools, hardware and building supplies.
   - B18 BP CONNECT → 7300 Fuel and Oil.
   - B12 M&S sandwiches for a client meeting → 7403 Entertainment.
   - B5 GUMTREE office desk → 0040 Furniture and Fixtures.
   - B8 ARGOS laptop → 0030 Office Equipment.
7. **The opening balance (9,000.00) is not booked.** No opening balances are entered, so the trial balance holds the year's transactions only, so 1200
   shows the movement, +1,495.93.
