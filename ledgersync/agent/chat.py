"""The accountant chat as the API serves it (design of 2026-11-02, replies of 2026-11-03): its threads, a message's
turn, and the answers.

A turn reads the files sent with the message into the client's documents, runs the agent on the message, and then,
whatever the agent did, records the dates matching took from the bank, works the questions out and posts the year,
under the client's lock. It ends with its result, built from the records: what this chat sorted in the turn, the
questions the turn raised (every open one when the agent listed them), and the posted trial balance when the turn
posted something or the agent fetched it. The thread keeps the result with the files the turn read, under the id of
the person's message, and reopening the chat shows each with its reply. A turn runs on a thread of its own and goes
on to the end if the person goes away.
An answer is applied without the model (questions.answer) and then noted in the chat's memory, for the agent alone; a
document sent for a question is read, the year posted again, and the question says why the document didn't settle it
if it didn't. Each returns the question as it stands and only what that did."""
