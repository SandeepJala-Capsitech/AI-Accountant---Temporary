"""Who may work on what at once, for the chat API, in this process (ported from the accounting-agent runner, 947ae1b,
which kept one job running for each client). A chat runs one message at a time: another while it runs is refused,
and an answer waits its turn. The writes that end a turn or apply an answer (dating rows from the bank, working out
the questions, posting) take the client's lock and wait their turn for it, so two chats on one client never post at
once."""
