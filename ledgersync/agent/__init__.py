"""The accountant chat's agent (design of 2026-11-02): LangChain's create_agent loop with the tools that read the books
and resolve what the evidence settles, a prompt that makes it the client's accountant, and limits on how long a run
goes. It only investigates and picks actions: the services check and make every change, and the server posts, asks
the rules' questions and builds the summary after each turn."""
