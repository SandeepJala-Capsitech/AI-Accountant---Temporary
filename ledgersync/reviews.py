"""The background AI review: once a client has been quiet for a while after a person changed its books, the agent
reviews what changed on its own. A change that needs a review makes the client due (note); the Worker runs the due
clients one at a time, and run() does one client's review: per open year, the agent is pointed at what changed and at
the issues no earlier review has looked at, the books are settled, and the run is recorded with what it decided and
asked. The watermark is the change `seq`; a change that arrives during a run leaves the client due, so one more run
