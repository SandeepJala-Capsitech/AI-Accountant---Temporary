"""The posted ledger the accountant chat shows. The pages' trial balance is worked out from the rows on every read and
never stored; this one is stored, and only ever added to. Each posting compares what every row of a year should
post now, after the document rules, with what is already posted for that row, and writes the difference as one
batch: a row whose lines changed gets a reversal of each line it has posted and its lines afresh; a row no longer
booked gets the reversals alone. A batch is checked whole before anything is written. Money is kept as Decimal128.
